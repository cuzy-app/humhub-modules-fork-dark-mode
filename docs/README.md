# Dark Mode for HumHub

This module adds a dark mode to HumHub. It is based on the community theme.

## How it works

The module adds a button to the top bar with which you can switch between light and dark mode.

Once the button has been clicked, a cookie ("theme") is added and the page is reloaded with (or without) the dark stylesheet.

## Theme Compatibility

Technically, it works with any theme. But the dark styles do not adapt to the current theme. So it is recommended to use it with the community theme.
